# Barebones programming language
This is my repo for CS111 - Spring 2021, University of Information Technology, VNU HCM. In this repo,I try to create a barebones compiler using C++.
Barebones programming language is a low level language which includes only basic statements to execute a simple program.

## Introduction 

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20-1.0.0-brightgreen%20)

## How i create barebones

## How to run program
Clone my git:

> ```git clone https://github.com/BTrDung/barebones-language.git```

Run command in your terminal: 

> ```g++ barebones.cpp -o bb;```

Run barebones by using ```./bb``` and link to your file ```*.bb```

> ```./bb ./examples/test.bb```

## Examples barebones program
Two simple sample barebones programs are provided in the "examples" subdirectory. ```test1.bb``` will compute A + B. For example, to compute A + B:

> ```./bb ./examples/test1.bb```

### Requirements
`g++ 9.3.0` or later


## Installation
```g++```: [Download](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
